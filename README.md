# Crush_Rate
This data set contains approximately 8000 records. Each record represents a customer at an auto insurance company. Each record has two target variables. The first target variable, TARGET_FLAG, is a 1 or a 0. A “1” means that the person was in a car crash. A zero means that the person was not in a car crash. 

The second target variable is TARGET_AMT. This value is zero if the person did not crash their car. But if they did crash their car, this number will be a value greater than zero. Your second part of this assignment is to come up with a model to predict what it will cost you if a person does crash their car.
